# Sheogorath — The Mind of Madness

## Quest Summary
Absurdity as weapon: solve a madness puzzle to earn a weapon that shouldn’t make sense (but does).

## Recommended Act
Act II–III

## Key Beats
- Meet the “strange man” and accept the trial.
- Enter a surreal scenario (challenge/contest).
- Solve by embracing weird logic.
- Leave with the Wabbajack (or a scar).

## Choice Points
- Play along vs resist (harder).
- Use madness kindly vs cruelly.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Wabbajack:** Once per session, replace an Attack with a *wild* Create Advantage at +2 that transforms the situation (GM chooses a weird but helpful twist).

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Jester‑Touched**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Sheogorath** up when chaos is embraced. Fill = reality glitches; Dragonbreak‑flavored scenes get more likely.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “Nothing Stays Normal”
- “Madness Is Contagious”
- “The Joke’s On You”
