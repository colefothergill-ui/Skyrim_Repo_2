# Hermaeus Mora — Discerning the Transmundane

## Quest Summary
Forbidden knowledge: the kind that makes you useful… and owned.

## Recommended Act
Act II–III

## Key Beats
- Investigate an obscure Dwemer/arcane lead.
- Gather blood/essences or pages (a multi‑step challenge).
- Open the path to the knowledge vault.
- Accept the Oghma Infinium and its “gift.”

## Choice Points
- Pursue knowledge despite consequences vs destroy/deny it.
- Share the secret with allies vs hoard it.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Oghma Infinium:** Once per session, gain +2 to an Overcome roll involving Lore/Investigate. After use, add/flip a scene aspect: **“The Book Whispers Back.”**

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Reader of the Infinite Library**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Mora** up when the PC chooses knowledge over people. Fill = tentacled omens; obsession compels; Thalmor seek the same lore.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “Curiosity Eats Sleep”
- “Secrets Aren’t Free”
- “The Book Wants a Price”

## Cross‑Links
Pairs well with **College of Winterhold** and Act V investigations.
