# Mehrunes Dagon — Pieces of the Past

## Quest Summary
The Mythic Dawn’s relics still rot under Skyrim’s floorboards. Dagon wants you to open the box.

## Recommended Act
Act III

## Key Beats
- Investigate the museum / cult remnants.
- Recover fragments of the Razor.
- Choose whether to restore it and what to do with the cultist curator.

## Choice Points
- Spare vs kill the curator (dark deed for power).
- Restore the Razor vs deny it.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Mehrunes’ Razor:** Once per session, after you succeed with style on an Attack, you may declare it becomes a *decisive* hit (take out) if it fits fiction. GM may require a Fate point for high‑stakes targets.

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Agent of Destruction (Dagon’s Razor)**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Dagon** up when chaos is chosen for power. Fill = violent cult resurgence; “accidents” around the PC.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “Power Loves Ruin”
- “Cultists Seek the Razor”
- “Destruction Solves Nothing”
