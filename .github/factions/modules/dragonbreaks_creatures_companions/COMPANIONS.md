# Companions (Party Play for Solo Campaigns)

Companions are **relationship engines**. Give each companion:
- 2 aspects (public + private)
- 1 signature stunt
- a 4‑segment **Trust Clock** with the PC

## Using Trust Clocks
- Tick up when the PC protects/supports the companion, keeps promises, or shares vulnerability.
- Tick down (or add a negative aspect) when the PC lies, abandons, or endangers them.

## Quick Companion Template
- Name:
- High Concept:

- Trust Clock: 0/4
- “Best Scene Hook”: (one sentence)

## Where To Store
- Existing companion writeups are in `npcs/`.
- If you want a party-only index, use `companions_party/NPC_INDEX.md`.
