# Agran Moorcroft — Appearance & Backstory

## Appearance
Agran looks like a handsome Breton in his late twenties to early thirties—*and that’s the first lie he tells the world every day.*

He is lean and athletic, posture immaculate, the kind of stance that reads “professor” until you notice it also reads “commander.” His skin is pale in a way moonlight seems to approve of, and his eyes are a striking icy blue—steady, attentive, and occasionally unsettling in their calm. Dark hair falls in wavy, mid-length layers around sharp cheekbones and a roguish mouth, with a neat five‑o’clock shadow that keeps him looking more “dashing academic” than “sleep‑deprived necromancer.”

He favors layered College robes and travel-wear in deep burgundy and warm brown leathers, trimmed with subtle gold thread. Wrapped forearms, a wide sash, and a small satchel at his hip suggest a man who expects to work—chalk, notes, tools, and contingency plans close at hand. When he casts, his Alteration manifests as clean geometric lattices and luminous rune-circles, like reality itself has agreed to be edited by careful handwriting.


## Backstory
Peryn Ashhart was born to land, legacy, and expectation—an Ashhart lordling of Daggerfall in High Rock, in the late Second Era, after Tiber Septim declared the Third Empire (2E 854) and began the long work of binding Tamriel beneath a single banner. The Ashharts were not merely wealthy; they were *useful*: a battlemage-blooded house with soldiers in their retinue, spellwrights in their halls, and friends in courts that smiled while sharpening knives. In a time when allegiance could be bought with coin, marriage, or blood, the Ashharts excelled at all three—and raised their heir accordingly.

Peryn had talent in obscene abundance. As a boy he bent stone and motion the way other children bent twigs; as a young man he was called a magical prodigy with a particular gift for Alteration—an instinctive grasp of weight, force, and form that made tutors proud and rivals quietly afraid. He trained as both mage and martial soldier, because his family understood what the world does to geniuses who cannot defend their own throats.

When the Septim conquest machine rolled forward—years of treaties, sieges, annexations, and “unifications”—Peryn’s gifts found their “proper” use: war. He entered the Imperial Legion as a battlemage and rose swiftly into command, earning the rank of Commander while still young enough for veterans to resent it. His name followed him into Hammerfell during the bitter Crown–Forebear conflict of the Tiber Wars, where Imperial “aid” arrived with chains hidden in the handshake and politics could be as lethal as steel.

His service carried him onward toward Morrowind as well—an Imperial push that culminated in the Armistice and the Empire’s final unification of Tamriel in 2E 896. In the stories told afterward, Vivec himself negotiated terms with Tiber Septim so Morrowind would enter the Empire while retaining wide local authority—Imperial law beside Great House law, and the Empire politely looking the other way where it benefited stability. Peryn witnessed enough of that campaign to understand a brutal truth: the Empire did not always win by crushing. Sometimes it won by bargaining with gods, then calling it peace.

He did not die in battle.

On the road back to the Imperial City—homeward, triumphant, exhausted—Peryn was taken. A woman he had been courting, an Imperial mage of rare talent and rarer ambition, sold him with a kiss and a lie. The ambush was quiet and surgical: warded wagons, sleep-magic, a gag that tasted like cold iron. The captors were Cyrodiilic vampyrs calling themselves **“The Order.”** They did not want his blood for hunger. They wanted his name, his rank, his access—an instrument that could be pointed at the heart of a newborn Empire, a proxy through which their will could touch the throne.

Peryn endured. He learned the discipline of silence. He learned what it means to be unmade and rebuilt. In the end, he was turned—Sanguinare Vampiris transmuted into something permanent, something that rewrote every oath he had ever sworn. When he returned to the world, rumors clung to his footsteps like grave-dust: arrows that should have felled him did not. Sword-edges that should have opened him met uncanny resistance. In battle he moved with an unnerving inevitability, and men began calling him “undying,” half in awe and half in fear.

That infamy drew hunters the way blood draws wolves.

A legendary vampire hunter finally cornered him—fighting not the man, but the monster the stories demanded. Peryn was nearly slain; the world went grey; The Order treated his suffering like a ledger entry. And then the Imperial woman returned—not out of love, but out of complicated guilt, calculation, or both. She bought him seconds. She opened a path. Peryn crawled through it, leaving behind the life that could no longer be lived.

He fled to Skyrim and buried “Peryn Ashhart” like a body in winter soil. He became **Moorcroft**—a name chosen for its plainness, its utility, and its distance from the Iliac Bay’s knives. In Winterhold he found something he hadn’t expected to want: study without banners, power without politics, a place where knowledge could still be sacred. Across the centuries he learned to vanish in plain sight, adopting a new name every few generations, a one‑man bloodline that outlived its own fingerprints.

**Master Agran Moorcroft.** Alteration scholar. Teacher. Gentleman.

And beneath it all—Commander Peryn, the Undying—still listening for the night when **The Order** decides the past is due.
