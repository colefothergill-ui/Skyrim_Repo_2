# Thieves Guild — Shadows of the Rift

## Fantasy Pitch
Crime as community… and then the god of shadows sends you a contract.

## Recommended Act
**Act II–III** (pairs nicely with Rift politics and Act II hold shifts).

## Core Beats
1. **The Hook:** Brynjolf tests the PC; Riften’s corruption is obvious
2. **Rebuild the Guild:** jobs, favors, leverage
3. **Mercer’s Betrayal:** the Guild’s heart is stolen
4. **Karliah & the Truth:** Nocturnal’s shadow touches everything
5. **Nightingale Oath:** reclaim the Guild (and possibly become Guildmaster)

## Clocks
- **thieves_guild_restoration (6):** progress toward Guildmaster + Nocturnal’s pact.
- Optional: **maven_leverage (4):** political debt; fill = Maven demands payment.

## War Integration
- Smuggling, sabotage, blackmail of war profiteers.
- Can soften a hold takeover by controlling criminal networks rather than burning cities.

## Rewards
### Nightingale Shadowcloak (Stunt)
Once per scene, when you vanish into darkness or misdirection, gain **+2** to Create Advantage using Stealth/Deceit.

### Daedric Link
Completing this arc effectively completes **Nocturnal’s** “champion” track.

## GM Compels
- “Guild Reputation”
- “Debt to Maven”
- “Nocturnal Collects”
