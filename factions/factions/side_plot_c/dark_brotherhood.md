# Dark Brotherhood — Black Sacrament

## Fantasy Pitch
A murder cult as a political weapon. Cozy.

## Recommended Act
**Act II–III**, with an Act IV–V payoff (assassination plots and the Thalmor twist).

## Core Beats
1. **The Invitation:** a killing draws the Brotherhood’s attention
2. **Sanctuary Politics:** internal rivalries and paranoia
3. **High‑Value Contract:** destabilize a hold / kill a key leader / eliminate a Thalmor pawn (or asset)
4. **Betrayal & Purge:** the Sanctuary is compromised
5. **The Final Contract:** an act that reshapes the war (or exposes the “true enemy”)

## Clocks
- **dark_brotherhood_emperor_plot (6):** progress toward “final contract” moment.
- Optional: **sanctuary_exposed (4):** fills = raid/attack.

## War Integration
- Brotherhood actions can *tilt* Act IV: a commander dies, a treaty is prevented, or a truce is forced.

## Rewards
### Shadow’s Favor (Stunt)
When you attack from surprise or with hidden intent, gain **+2** to Create Advantage using Stealth/Deceit.

### Moral Cost
Always attach a campaign aspect like **“Blood on the Ledger”** (compel bait forever).

## GM Compels
- “Contract Above Conscience”
- “Witnesses Don’t Stay Quiet”
- “The Night Mother Whispers”
