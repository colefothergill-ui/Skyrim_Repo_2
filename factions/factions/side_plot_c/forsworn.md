# Forsworn — The Reach Bleeds

## Fantasy Pitch
Oppression, rebellion, and the question of whether “freedom” can be built from slaughter.

## Recommended Act
**Act II**, with ripples through the endgame (Markarth is a powder keg).

## Core Beats
1. **Cidhna Mine / The Spark:** the PC is forced to deal with Reach justice
2. **Rebel Contact:** learn the Forsworn’s side (or their propaganda)
3. **Choice Point:** crush them, negotiate, or redirect them against the Thalmor
4. **Uprising:** a three‑way conflict becomes possible (Imperial vs Stormcloak vs Forsworn)
5. **Outcome:** peace pact, bloodbath, or hidden insurgency

## Clocks
- **forsworn_rebellion (6):** escalation toward open uprising.
- Optional: **markarth_crackdown (4):** fills = brutal retaliation.

## War Integration
- Act II battles in the Reach can be complicated by Forsworn action.
- A negotiated Forsworn outcome can provide guerrilla support against Dominion agents in Act V.

## Rewards
### Reach‑Wise (Stunt)
Gain **+2** to Overcome using Notice/Survival when navigating wilderness, ruins, or ambush terrain in the Reach.

## GM Compels
- “Old Grievances, Fresh Knives”
- “No One Owns The Reach”
- “The Price of Peace”
