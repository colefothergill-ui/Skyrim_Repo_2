# Companions — Circle of Honor

## Fantasy Pitch
Viking werewolf mercenaries with a code… until you realize the code is *haunted*.

## Recommended Act
**Act I–II**, then resolves by **Act III** (so it can matter in Act IV sieges).

## Core Beats
1. **Proving Valor:** brawl/contract to earn a place in Jorrvaskr
2. **The Silver Hand:** reveal that someone is hunting “the Circle”
3. **The Truth of the Circle:** offer of lycanthropy (or refusal)
4. **Ruin & Revenge:** storm a stronghold; confront betrayal
5. **Harbinger’s Mantle:** become Harbinger (or kingmaker behind the scenes)

## Clocks
- **companions_harbinger (6):** ticks each time the PC completes a major contract/beat.
- Optional: **wolf_within (4):** ticks when the beast causes trouble; fill = forced transformation scene.

## War Integration
- Act II: Companions can escort civilians, sabotage supply lines, or hunt a Thalmor‑backed “monster unit.”
- Act IV: A Harbinger PC can rally Shield‑Siblings as a decisive scene advantage.

## Rewards
### Werewolf Boon (Extra)
Once per session, you may declare a **Beast‑Form Surge**:
- Gain **+2** on an Overcome/Create Advantage using Physique/Athletics/Fight **when feral strength matters**.
- Gain a scene aspect: **“The Beast is Close”** (GM gets free compels).

### Artifact: Axe of Ysgramor (Optional)
Treat as a *named weapon Extra*. It’s powerful because of story weight, not numbers:
- Once per session, reroll a Fight roll when defending a Companion oath.

## GM Compels
- “Hunted by the Silver Hand”
- “Honor Before Politics”
- “The Beast Demands Blood”
