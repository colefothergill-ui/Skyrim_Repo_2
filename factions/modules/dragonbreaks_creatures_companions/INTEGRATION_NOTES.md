# Dragonbreaks, Creatures, and Companions — Integration Notes

This module is a **GM toolbox** to keep solo-play momentum high:
- **Dragonbreak Moments** let you “branch” reality when the story would otherwise hard-stop.
- **Creatures** provide quick Fate-friendly stat blocks and scene aspects.
- **Companions** make your party feel alive (trust, banter, loyalties, consequences).

## Where Things Live
- Dragonbreak prompts: `story_branches/DRAGONBREAK_MOMENTS.json`
- Secret turn logic: `story_branches/DRAGONBREAK_SECRET_TURNS.md`
- Core campaign rails: `modules/acts/ACT_01...ACT_05...`
- Companion NPCs: `npcs/` (and `companions_party/` if you want a separate party index)

## When to Use a Dragonbreak Moment
Use one when:
- a failure would stall play instead of creating new story,
- the PC makes a choice that logically splits the timeline,
- a major clock fills and you want to preserve momentum without a total reset.

**Rule of thumb:** a Dragonbreak doesn’t erase consequences— it *reframes* them.

## Mechanical Suggestions
- Treat each Dragonbreak as a **Create Advantage** for reality:
  - place an aspect like **“Reality Frayed”** with 1–2 free invokes
  - then immediately compel it later to keep the cosmic weirdness “paid for”
