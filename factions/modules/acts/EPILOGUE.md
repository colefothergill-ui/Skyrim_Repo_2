# Epilogue — Skyrim’s New Dawn

## What This Is
This is the quiet after the storm. The Civil War is resolved (by victory or truce), Act V’s Thalmor endgame
was confronted, and now the PCs get to **cash in consequences**—political, personal, and spiritual.

## Epilogue Goals
- Close open clocks (or leave *one* thread as a hook for a new season)
- Pay off major NPC relationships (Hadvar/Ralof, Jarls, faction leaders)
- Let the PCs define what “peace” means in *their* Skyrim

## State of Skyrim (Choose One)
### Stormcloak Victory
Skyrim stands free—bruised, proud, and politically volatile. The Moot convenes. A new national aspect can
be placed: **“Pride of a Unified Skyrim”** (or **“A Kingdom Learning Mercy”** if the PCs pushed reform).

### Imperial Victory
Skyrim remains in the Empire but with autonomy in practice. Elisif forms a council to prevent a repeat.
New aspect: **“Reforms Written in Blood”**.

### Truce / Stalemate
No faction “wins,” but Skyrim survives the Thalmor’s pressure. New aspect: **“Uneasy Unity”**.

## Optional Epilogue Scenes (Pick 2–4)
- **The Moot / Council:** the PCs speak, bargain, or threaten their way into policy
- **A War Memorial:** a heartfelt scene where former enemies honor the dead
- **A Hold Rebuild:** choose one city the PCs care about; let them fix one civic wound
- **Factions Settle Accounts:** Companions/College/Guild/Brotherhood/Forsworn/Thalmor threads resolve
- **The Dragonborn Cameo:** the Dragonborn returns briefly—*not* to steal the spotlight, but to acknowledge
  the PCs as Skyrim’s new legends. A single gift or blessing as a one‑time invoke is enough.

## Mechanical Wrap‑Up
- Clear any campaign aspect that no longer makes sense (e.g., “Civil Unrest” in holds now stabilized).
- Convert 1–2 long‑term consequences into scars/aspects (the story keeps them).
- Award a **Final Major Milestone** (or **Minor** if you want a sequel).

## Closing Line (Use or Ignore)
The snow keeps falling. The land keeps breathing. And the next time the Dominion looks north—
Skyrim looks back.
