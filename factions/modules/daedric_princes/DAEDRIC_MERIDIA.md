# Meridia — The Break of Dawn

## Quest Summary
A beacon in the sky, a temple full of undead, and a Prince who *hates* necromancy with holy fury.

## Recommended Act
Act II

## Key Beats
- Find the Beacon; get summoned.
- Cleanse the temple (combat + puzzle).
- Confront the necromancer; restore the light.

## Choice Points
- Destroy the undead at all costs vs protect innocents first.
- Accept Meridia’s zeal vs question her methods.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Dawnbreaker:** Once per scene, when you strike undead/necromantic foes, create advantage **“Burning Radiance”** with one free invoke.

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Lightbearer of Meridia**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Meridia** up when the PC crusades against undead. Fill = blinding omens; zeal compels; undead shrink back from the PC’s reputation.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “No Mercy for the Undead”
- “Blinding Zeal”
- “Light Demands Purity”
