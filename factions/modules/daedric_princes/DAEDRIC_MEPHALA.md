# Mephala — The Whispering Door

## Quest Summary
A locked door in a Jarl’s palace. A voice. A blade that feeds on betrayal.

## Recommended Act
Act II

## Key Beats
- Hear rumors; investigate the locked door.
- Acquire the key through stealth/social pressure.
- Take the Ebony Blade… and decide whether it will *eat.*

## Choice Points
- Leave it sealed vs claim it.
- Feed it with betrayal vs refuse and keep it dormant.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Ebony Blade:** Once per session, heal 1 stress/consequence step after taking out a foe you *personally betrayed* (fiction matters). GM compels “hunger for treachery.”

## Champion Mechanic

**Whisper‑Chosen**

## Daedric Influence
