# Namira — The Taste of Death

## Quest Summary
Cannibal cult horror with a smile. This is the “are we still the heroes?” quest.

## Recommended Act
Act III

## Key Beats
- Meet the desperate victim; learn of the cult.
- Infiltrate the feast (social horror).
- Choose: purge the cult, join it, or manipulate it.

## Choice Points
- Expose and destroy vs participate.
- Save the victim vs sacrifice them for acceptance.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Ring of Namira:** Once per session, recover from a mild physical consequence by consuming something horrific (narratively gross). GM compels social fallout.

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Feast‑Blessed**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Namira** up when the PC embraces taboo for power. Fill = social rot; whispers; allies recoil.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “Hunger Beyond Hunger”
- “People Look at You Different”
- “Taboo Is a Door”
