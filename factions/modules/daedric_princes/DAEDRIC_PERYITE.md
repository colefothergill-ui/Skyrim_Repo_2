# Peryite — The Only Cure

## Quest Summary
Plague, poison, and a Prince who thinks “balance” means suffering is a tool.

## Recommended Act
Act III

## Key Beats
- Track the afflicted; discover the cult’s origin.
- Navigate a toxic ruin / dreamlike pocket realm.
- Stop the source—or take control of it.

## Choice Points
- Cure the afflicted vs weaponize the sickness.
- Kill the cult leader vs bargain.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Spellbreaker (or Peryite’s Boon):** Once per scene, gain +2 to defend vs poison/disease/magical decay; create advantage **“Resisted the Rot.”**

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Bearer of the Only Cure**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Peryite** up when the PC uses sickness/decay as leverage. Fill = outbreaks and “cleansing” cults spread.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “Rot Spreads Quietly”
- “Balance Through Pain”
- “Toxic Solutions”
