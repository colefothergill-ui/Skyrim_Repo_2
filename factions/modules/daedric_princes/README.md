# Daedric Princes Module

This folder contains **one file per Daedric Prince quest** (Skyrim-era), plus Nocturnal (handled via the
Thieves Guild arc but documented here for cross‑reference).

## How These Fit the Civil War Campaign
- Daedric quests are *optional* side arcs that can be woven into Acts I–V.
- Each quest offers:
  - a **Daedric Artifact** (as an Extra),
  - a **Champion Aspect** (if the PC accepts the Prince’s path),
  - and a **Daedric Influence** impact that can complicate the world.

## Daedric Influence Clocks
Use `clocks/daedric_influence_clocks.json` to track how much each Prince’s “vibe” is leaking into Skyrim.
When a clock fills, introduce a lasting campaign/hold aspect (or a Dragonbreak‑style weirdness).

## Quick Links
- `DAEDRIC_NOCTURNAL.md` — cross‑links the Thieves Guild Nightingale pact
- `DAEDRIC_HERMAEUS_MORA.md` — Oghma Infinium / forbidden knowledge arc (pairs well with the College)
