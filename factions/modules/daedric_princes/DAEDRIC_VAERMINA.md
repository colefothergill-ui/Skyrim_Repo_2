# Vaermina — Waking Nightmare

## Quest Summary
Dawnstar can’t sleep, and nightmares are political weapons when the world is already unstable.

## Recommended Act
Act II–III

## Key Beats
- Investigate the town’s sleepless terror.
- Enter the nightmare realm (challenge).
- Choose whether to destroy or exploit the artifact causing it.

## Choice Points
- Destroy the source vs keep it for leverage.
- Save innocents first vs pursue the Prince’s promise of power.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Skull of Corruption:** Once per session, create advantage **“Borrowed Nightmare”** with one free invoke by weaponizing fear/visions. GM compels collateral trauma.

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Dream‑Thief**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Vaermina** up when fear is used as a tool. Fill = mass panic; prophetic nightmares about Act V.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “Sleep Is a Battlefield”
- “Nightmares Leave Scars”
- “Fear Spreads”
