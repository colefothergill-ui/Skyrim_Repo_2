<<GAME SAVED>>

Falkreath did not sleep that night.

The pines stood black and tall beyond the palisade, their needles whispering like a jury that had not yet reached its verdict. Smoke curled from chimneys as it always did, but the town’s warmth felt borrowed—drawn from hearths that suddenly seemed too small for the weight now pressing on every door and window. Men and women who had spent years learning to swallow their doubts found their tongues loosening in the same breath, as if fear had finally grown tired of being quiet.

They would say later that the air changed first.

Not the weather—Skyrim does not bargain with weather—but the taste of it. Something metallic. Something like the moment before a storm breaks. And those who were there in the Jarl’s longhouse would swear it was the Voice that did it: not as the Greybeards use it, high and holy on a mountain, but as a Nord uses it when the world stops listening to anything else.

Eltric Stagborne—Thane no longer, monk no longer, but still carrying the old discipline like an iron band around his ribs—had returned to Falkreath on a seam of broken time. The Dragonbreak came like a cruel joke and a holy omen in the same breath: wax in his hand, pain behind his eyes, the Bannered Mare smearing into nothing—and then the longhouse, the high seat, and Jarl Siddgeir staring at him as if the gods had sent him a bill.

There was no gentle path from there.

A Dominion writ surfaced in the firelight, stamped and filed, written with the cold confidence of those who think they own the future. A forgery of Stagborne wax—almost perfect, wrong by a notch—sat like a confession on the table. The hall watched the young Jarl’s mask slip, watched a Thalmor Justiciar reveal herself from the rafters like rot exposed beneath varnish. They watched Eltric name Talos in a place where clever men pretended not to hear it. They watched the Voice become a weapon, the room become a drum, and authority tumble from the high seat in a humiliating sprawl of limbs and panic.

Rumor would later claim the Thalmor smiled even while bleeding.

Rumor would later claim Eltric smiled back.

But the truth, as Falkreath felt it in its bones, was simpler: the Stagborne did not come to negotiate with serpents. He came to end them.

The Thalmor’s agent did not die in the longhouse—she escaped on contingency magicka, leaving behind proof like spilled ink: a satchel, a stamp-matrix, and paper that could not be laughed away. And once paper exists, Skyrim’s great gift asserts itself: people talk. They talk in taverns. They talk in markets. They talk when they think they’re alone. The truth is not a sword; it is a contagion.

So Eltric moved fast.

Dead Man’s Drink, that old tavern squatting in the shadow of the palisade, had always served ale and secrets in equal measure. Beneath it—behind a false cask marked Juniper Mash—sat a root-cellar drop that did not belong to Falkreath. Cipher packets. Filed coins with shaved sunbursts. A ledger strip of coded marks. And a note with one brutal word: STAG. As if the Dominion’s cruelty had learned to write your name like a target.

An ambush waited above the stairs. Blades hired for coin. A “Cleaner” with practiced stillness. Nenya, Siddgeir’s steward, pale and desperate—too deep in the machine to believe mercy was still real. Eltric’s Voice shattered their advantage before it began. Steel clattered and skittered, panic took the place of planning, and the landing became a narrow stage where fear had nowhere to hide. The Cleaner fell to Elder Elk’s Edge. The hired blades broke and bled. And when Eltric’s hand closed around Nenya’s throat, the room learned the difference between justice and wrath—because he could have killed her, and he did not.

He let her live. Unconscious. Bound. Breathing.

That choice mattered more than the blood.

The guards arrived to a scene that could not be dressed into a lie: a Thalmor operative down, hired violence scattered, and the steward of Falkreath captured alive. Orders snapped into place like a chain being forged. Nenya was hauled to the dungeons under witness. Evidence was bagged and marked under Stagborne authority, not Siddgeir’s. Riders were sent—one to Whiterun, one to Windhelm—with copies and statements, names of witnesses, and enough paper to make the story survive fire.

And in the longhouse, the high seat remained empty.

Eltric called for a Moot.

He named Siddgeir “former Jarl” and ordered him taken in irons. The hall—once trained to accept profit as governance—shifted in the presence of proof and fury. Old Falkreath names murmured that they remembered the Stagborne. Remembered the father. Remembered how quickly loyalty had been punished and coin had replaced heart. When Eltric spoke of Falkreath’s pine and its people, when he claimed the hold needed a Jarl who would prioritize its heart, the room did not laugh. It listened. It weighed him like a blade in the hand.

Outside, the pines whispered. Inside, the hold’s future wavered, not as a question of whether Siddgeir would remain, but of what would rise in his place.

Some would call Eltric a hero that night. Some would call him a monster. Both camps would agree on one thing: Falkreath was no longer asleep.

And somewhere beyond the palisade, somewhere in the Dominion’s quiet halls and hidden ledgers, someone would look down at a column of ink and realize that the Stag had stopped running and started hunting.
