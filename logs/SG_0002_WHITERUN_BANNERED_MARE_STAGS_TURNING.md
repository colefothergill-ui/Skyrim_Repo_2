# SAVE GAME — SG_0002_WHITERUN_BANNERED_MARE_STAGS_TURNING
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-06 23:07 (local)
**Act:** ACT_1
**Scene:** S4_BANNERED_MARE_STAGS_TURNING
**Location:** Whiterun — The Bannered Mare
**PC:** Eltric Stagborne (Nord) — Champion of Ulfric

## Snapshot Summary
Eltric, alongside Aela and Farkas, completed the Whiterun counter-intelligence operation by capturing the final Thalmor pivot alive (no evidence destroyed). The cell’s operations were publicly exposed via evidence chain (satchel contents + Dominion-clean token/ring + handler confirmation) with witnesses present, preventing a Thalmor narrative victory and securing legitimacy.

Eltric swore the Whiterun Oath before Jarl Balgruuf (via Irileth): no purge, no mob justice, no “hunting ground.” Balgruuf signed the Whiterun Accord and formally chose Skyrim’s cause on Whiterun’s terms (trial and due process, Whiterun Guard remains Whiterun Guard).

Cut back to the Bannered Mare. Celebration begins. A new lead appears: a sealed note marked with Falkreath wax (Stagborne stamp) is delivered to Eltric, suggesting an immediate Falkreath/Siddgeir thread.

## Key Outcomes
- Thalmor Whiterun sabotage cell: neutralized; pivot captured alive; evidence secured.
- Legate Cipius: detained under Balgruuf authority; alive pending public trial.
- Balgruuf: “conditional” ally removed; Whiterun chooses and signs accord.
- Eltric: Champion status confirmed; political leverage increases.

## Evidence Secured
- Satchel: names, coded contacts, guard rotations, routing notes.
- Dominion-clean token/ring.
- Handler directives/meeting phrase paper.
- Witnessed confession record + public proof presentation.

## Active Leads
- Falkreath wax note (Stagborne seal) — unopened; likely Siddgeir/Thalmor linkage.
- Trial prep: Cipius + implicated local collaborators.
- Expected retaliation: Thalmor counter-move likely imminent.
