# College of Winterhold — The Eye of Magnus

## Fantasy Pitch
You’re doing grad school during a civil war, and the final exam is “don’t explode reality.”

## Recommended Act
**Act II–III**, with ripples into Act IV/Act V (Thalmor interest is spicy here).

## Core Beats
1. **Admission:** first lesson, magical mishap, suspicion from locals
2. **The Discovery:** the Eye (or equivalent) is found—ancient and dangerous
3. **Crisis Escalation:** reality bends; wards fail; Winterhold panics
4. **The Saboteur:** uncover who is pushing catastrophe (Thalmor agent / extremist mage / artifact curse)
5. **Resolution:** contain the Eye; decide who leads the College afterward

## Clocks
- **college_eye_of_magnus (6):** ticking crisis clock.
- Optional: **winterhold_fear (4):** locals turn hostile if it fills.

## War Integration
- The College can be a neutral “buffer power” between factions.
- Thalmor may attempt to claim the artifact or frame one side for the calamity.

## Rewards
### Artifact: Staff of Magnus (Extra)
Once per scene, spend a Fate point to:
- **Neutralize** a magical effect (Overcome at +2) *or*
- Create advantage **“Wards Holding (for now)”** with one free invoke.

### Title
- **Arch‑Mage** (or “Mage‑Advisor”) as a narrative permission and reputation aspect.

## GM Compels
- “Mages are not trusted”
- “Arcane power attracts the Dominion”
- “Knowledge at any cost”
