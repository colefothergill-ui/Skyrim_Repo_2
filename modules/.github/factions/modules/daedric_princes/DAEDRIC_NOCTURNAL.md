# Nocturnal — Nightingale Oath

## Quest Summary
Nocturnal’s questline is woven into the Thieves Guild arc: the price of shadow‑power is *service.*

## Recommended Act
Act II–III (via Thieves Guild)

## Key Beats
- Complete key Thieves Guild beats (Mercer betrayal, Karliah truth).
- Take the Nightingale oath (or refuse and accept consequences).
- Secure the Guild’s future.

## Choice Points
- Swear the oath vs attempt to break/avoid it.
- Serve Nocturnal openly vs keep it secret.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Skeleton Key / Nightingale Gifts:** As story permission: once per session, bypass a lock/security obstacle with style (Create Advantage at +2) if shadowy fiction supports it.

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Nightingale of the Ebon Shadow**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Nocturnal** up when secrecy and shadow bargains pay off. Fill = shadow‑omens; the Guild becomes a major political lever.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “The Shadow Collects”
- “Oaths Bind”
- “Secrets Have Weight”
