# Molag Bal — The House of Horrors

## Quest Summary
Domination, cruelty, and the temptation to become the monster that wins.

## Recommended Act
Act III

## Key Beats
- Follow the lead into an “abandoned” house.
- A victim is trapped; Molag Bal’s trap tightens.
- Decide who suffers, who dies, and who walks out holding the mace.

## Choice Points
- Free the victim vs break them.
- If PC is a vampire, decide whether Bal becomes patron or a chain.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Mace of Molag Bal:** Once per session, when you win a social conflict by intimidation, you may also inflict a mild consequence **“Shaken Will”** on the target (fictional follow‑through required).

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Tyrant‑Touched**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Molag Bal** up when domination is chosen. Fill = nightmares, cruelty, and vampire politics tighten around the PC.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “Control Feels Easy”
- “The Weak Are Tools”
- “Chains You Can’t See”
