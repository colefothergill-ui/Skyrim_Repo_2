# Hircine — Ill Met by Moonlight

## Quest Summary
A hunt where the prey is a cursed man—and the curse is the point.

## Recommended Act
Act II–III (or earlier if lycanthropy is in play)

## Key Beats
- Track the quarry; learn the curse’s origin.
- Enter the hunt ground (literal or metaphorical).
- Decide the prey’s fate: mercy, death, or eternal hunt.

## Choice Points
- Spare the cursed hunter vs slay him for the Prince.
- If PC is a werewolf, decide whether Hircine becomes patron or rival.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Ring of Hircine / Savior’s Hide:** Pick one. Ring: once per session, ignore a consequence tied to exhaustion/fatigue (the hunt sustains you). Hide: once per scene, gain +2 to defend vs physical harm from beasts.

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Hircine’s Favored Hunter**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Hircine** up when the PC chooses predation, the hunt, or embraces the beast. Fill = hunts begin finding the PC.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “The Hunt Never Ends”
- “Blood Scent”
- “Predator Instinct”
