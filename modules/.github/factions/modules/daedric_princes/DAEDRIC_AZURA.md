# Azura — The Black Star

## Quest Summary
A soul gem that shouldn’t exist, a choice between mercy and power, and a Prince who *never* forgets.

## Recommended Act
Act II–III

## Key Beats
- Travel to Azura’s shrine; receive the directive.
- Enter the ruin to recover the Star’s broken form.
- Confront the mage who wants to corrupt it (or the spirit bound within).
- Cleanse the Star… or accept its blackened purpose.

## Choice Points
- Cleanse (safer, kinder) vs Corrupt (stronger, darker).
- Protect the soul within vs exploit it for utility.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Azura’s Star / The Black Star:** Once per session, declare a soul is bound (Create Advantage at +2) after you defeat a worthy foe. GM may compel the Star’s hunger/temptation.

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Star‑Bearer of Twilight**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Azura** up if the Star is restored and used. Fill = strange twilight omens; dreams with prophetic warnings.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “The Star Wants More”
- “Twilight Prophecies”
- “Prince’s Favor Has a Price”
