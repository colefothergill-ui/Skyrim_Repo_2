# Dragonbreaks (GM Tool)

A Dragonbreak is a lore-friendly “timeline wobble.” In Fate terms: it’s a structured permission to
introduce a twist that keeps play moving.

## Fast Procedure (60 seconds)
1. Name the break: *“The Snow Split”* / *“The Broken Oath”* / *“The Missing Hour”*
2. Choose a scope:
   - **Personal** (PC memory/body)
   - **Local** (one room/city)
   - **Regional** (one hold)
3. Place a scene aspect: **“Reality Frayed”** (1 free invoke)
4. Choose one:
   - **Retcon a detail** (not a whole scene)
   - **Split outcomes** (both happen in different ways)
   - **Introduce a third party** (Daedric, Thalmor, ancient magic)
5. Pay the bill later: compel Reality Frayed within 1–2 scenes.

## Examples
- A failed assassination prevention becomes: the target lives, but the PC is framed.
- A siege loss becomes: the city falls, but the civilian quarter is saved by a weird storm.
