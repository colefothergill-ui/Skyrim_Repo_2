## Appearance
Agran presents as a handsome Breton in his late twenties—almost unfairly well-kept, the kind of “healthy” that makes you realize some people are cheating.

- **Face:** sharp cheekbones, a neatly kept five-o’clock shadow, and an easy, charming smile that sometimes arrives half a heartbeat *after* his eyes do.  
- **Eyes:** pale, icy-blue and unnervingly bright in low light; when he’s focused, it can feel like being measured rather than observed.  
- **Hair:** dark, wavy, and mid-length, falling around his brow in an intentionally “effortless” scholar’s style.  
- **Dress:** layered academic robes in deep maroon with gold embroidery and a darker over-vestment; wrapped bracers, sturdy boots, and a practical belt pouch—half professor, half field-mage.  
- **Aura:** calm, warm-voiced, and polite… with the subtle gravity of someone who has commanded soldiers and doesn’t forget how.

## Aspects (with GM compel notes)
- **High Concept:** *Master Moorcroft of Alteration — Commander Peryn the Undying*  
  *Compels:* old military instincts pull him toward command decisions; old enemies recognize “Peryn”; his “undying” reputation invites fear, rumors, and dangerous curiosity.

- **Trouble:** *Secret of My Sanguine*  
  *Compels:* hunger and vampiric tells risk exposure; do-gooder situations conflict with predatory needs; enemies weaponize the stigma; allies may demand proof of trust.

- **Reputation:** *Master Agran — Every Student’s Favorite*  
  *Compels:* students seek him out at terrible times; he’s expected to be patient/merciful; rival faculty/authorities resent his influence; he’s “too visible” to stay hidden.

- **Past:** *Lord Peryn Ashhart, Raised by “The Order”*  
  *Compels:* The Order’s schemes resurface; old Imperial connections drag him into politics; unfinished vendettas; the woman who betrayed/saved him casts a long shadow.

- **Drive:** *Make Winterhold Eclipse the Imperial City’s “Blowhards”*  
  *Compels:* pride pushes him to take risks for the College; he’s tempted to “prove” Winterhold’s superiority at the worst moment; political rivals bait him.

## Backstory (narrative)
Agran Moorcroft has worn many names, but the first that mattered was **Lord Peryn Ashhart**—a Breton noble of Daggerfall, born in the late Second Era, when the newly-crowned Tiber Septim’s empire was still hardening from conquest into “order.” The Ashharts were the kind of family that bought influence with steel and scholarship alike: battlemages in the bloodline, coin in the coffers, and court connections sharpened to a point.

Peryn was the sort of prodigy that makes tutors either proud or unemployed. He learned Alteration the way others learned manners: early, fluently, and with a frightening ease. Where many mages treated the school as tricks and utility, Peryn treated it as *principle*—mass, force, density, the shape of momentum, the geometry of “possible.” And unlike many gifted scholars, he could also hold a blade and keep pace with soldiers who didn’t care about theory.

That combination—genius and grit—pulled him into the Legion. In the years of Septim consolidation, Peryn rose fast, earning command through Hammerfell’s hard lessons and the bitter, political edge of campaigns whose victories were measured as much in treaties as in bodies. His name became useful: a commander who could break a line, stabilize a breach, and keep mages from detonating their own side.

He did not fall in battle. He was taken.

On the road back toward the Imperial City, a courtship he thought was love became a knife—an Imperial woman of remarkable talent, smiling at his ambition while leading him into the hands of **The Order**, a Cyrodilic cabal of vampyrs who wanted a proxy inside the newborn empire. A prodigy commander close enough to matter. Close enough, perhaps, to reach the Dragon Throne itself. Peryn was made into something that could not die easily… and could not be allowed to live openly.

His legend followed. In skirmishes and shadow-wars, rumors grew: arrows that should have killed him did not; blades that drew blood did not finish the work. Soldiers spoke of him with a superstitious awe—**Peryn the Undying**—not knowing the truth beneath the story.

Eventually, a hunter found the thread. A vampire-slayer of enough renown to become a campfire name. Peryn was nearly ended—broken, burned, hunted to the edge of oblivion—only to be saved by the same Imperial woman who had betrayed him. Whether guilt, love, or strategy moved her, she cut him loose from The Order’s immediate grasp long enough for him to flee.

He ran north, where the ice and distance made good masks. In Skyrim he became **Agran Moorcroft**, and Winterhold became his refuge: a place where secrets were common, and scholarship could bury the past under centuries of new work. Every few generations he changes his name, his papers, his “origin”—a one-man bloodline threading through history—always returning to the College, always advancing Alteration, always trying to be better than the weapon he once was.

Now, at the Battle of Whiterun’s beginning, Agran stands again where war and magic intersect… and the sky itself seems ready to split.

## Notes
- **Known to the College leadership:** Mirabelle, Tolfdir, and the Archmage are aware (at least partially) of his condition.
- **Personal rule:** “Protect students first. Feed never, unless the alternative is worse.”
