# Elder Elk's Edge (Artifact Axe)

**Type:** Extra (Artifact Weapon)  
**Cost:** -1 Refresh (paid)  
**Permission:** Stagborne heir + Stormcloak Champion status

## Aspects
- **Artifact Aspect:** Relic of the Stagborne — an oath-drinking edge of old Skyrim
- **Trouble Aspect:** Demands honorable blood (duels, mercy, and consequences)

## Base Rules
- **Sunder Once Per Scene:** When you attack with **Fight** using the axe, once per scene you may treat the hit as if you had invoked an aspect for **+2 shifts** (describe sundering shield/armor/door/line).
- **Boost Option on Succeed with Style:** When you succeed with style on a Fight attack, you may create the boost **Stag's Mark** instead of dealing extra shifts.

## Integrated Traits (included in Refresh cost)
1) **Oath-Breaker's Bane:** +2 to Fight when attacking a proven traitor, infiltrator, or someone acting under a false banner (Thalmor handlers, paid spies, oath-breakers).  
2) **Voice in Steel:** Once per scene, you may use Fight instead of Will for a Thu'um roll if the shout is channeled through the axe (describe the edge humming with the Word).

## Upgrade Track (unlocks at Act milestones; no extra Refresh)
- **Act I — Mercy's Edge:** When you take out an enemy with the axe, you may spare them to gain a Fate Point *or* create **Spared Under Oath** with 1 free invoke.
- **Act II — Banner-Warden:** +2 to Rapport when rallying Stormcloak troops or militia while openly bearing the axe as your badge of office.
- **Act III — Crown-Sunder:** +2 to Create an Advantage to expose corruption, hidden command chains, or covert networks (choose Rapport, Contacts, or Lore).
- **Act IV — Falkreath Reclaimer:** Once per session in Stormcloak territory, declare a reasonable local asset (militia, steward, supply, safehouse) tied to Stagborne influence.
- **Act V — Throne-Claim:** Once per session, you may force a conflict into formal terms (challenge/duel/parley) by creating **By Right of the Stag** with 1 free invoke, if the fiction supports it.

## GM Notes
Compel the Trouble when the wielder is tempted to strike from ambush, execute prisoners, or win via terror instead of honor.
