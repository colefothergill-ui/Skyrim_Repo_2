# Act V — The True Enemy (Thalmor Endgame)

## Summary
The Civil War’s “winner” is only the *surface* ending. Act V reveals (or confirms) the Aldmeri Dominion’s
hidden hand: the Thalmor deliberately prolonged the war to keep Skyrim weak, divided, and politically
manageable. With decisive proof in hand, the PCs become the fulcrum of a dangerous pivot: **war victory**
must transform into **anti‑Thalmor action**, fast.

**Tone:** cloak‑and‑dagger, moral compromises, frantic sprint toward a finale.

## When to Run This
Run immediately after **Act IV — The Final Storm**. The capital has fallen (or a truce was brokered in the
battle’s chaos), but the Thalmor move to “stabilize” Skyrim on *their* terms.

## Core Question
Will Skyrim remain split by ideology… or can former enemies stand together long enough to stop a larger
one?

## Act Beats (Suggested 3–5 Sessions)
1. **The Proof** — The PCs secure undeniable evidence: coded correspondence, a sealed dossier, an agent’s
   confession, a ledger of payments, or a captured Justiciar.
2. **The Target** — Identify the Thalmor objective:
   - **Assassination:** remove key leaders (Ulfric / Elisif / Tullius / influential Jarls / the PC)
   - **Ritual:** unleash a Daedric horror or curse a hold to force Dominion “peacekeeping”
   - **Diplomatic Trap:** force a treaty that strips Skyrim of autonomy and purges dissent
   - **Artifact Operation:** steal/destroy a unifying symbol (Jagged Crown, royal regalia, a treaty seal)
3. **The Infiltration** — Embassy, outpost, or hidden cell. Social infiltration is valid; violence is loud.
4. **The Break** — The plan begins. A clock starts ticking. The PCs choose what they save first.
5. **Final Confrontation** — A high‑tier Thalmor antagonist (First Emissary / senior Justiciar / arcane
   commander) with elite backup and a nasty escape plan.

## Key Locations (Pick What Fits Your Campaign)
- **Thalmor Embassy** (most iconic; infiltration + social pressure cooker)
- **Hidden Dominion Outpost** (mountain fort, coastal ruin, or reclaimed Nordic barrow)
- **The Capital’s Court** (Solitude or Windhelm) during fragile aftermath politics
- **A Temple / Ancient Site** used for a ritual (pairs well if many Daedric quests were completed)

## Major NPCs (Drop‑In)
- **Thalmor Antagonist:** “First Emissary Arannelya” (use as a title if you prefer your own)
- **Broker Ally:** Malborn / Delphine / a College contact / a faction leader from Side Plot C
- **Reluctant Truce Figure:** Hadvar or Ralof (whichever is alive and meaningful)

## Clocks
Add these clocks (if not already present):
- **Thalmor Endgame** (6 segments): ticks when the PCs delay, fail rolls, or choose war politics over action.
- **Truce Fragility** (4 segments): ticks when old grievances flare; fills = truce collapses and Act V becomes harder.
- **Evidence Integrity** (4 segments): ticks when proof is lost, forged, or politically undermined.

## Mechanical Hooks (Fate Core Friendly)
- Treat major sequences as **Challenges** (3–5 rolls) or a **Contest** if opposing forces race for the same objective.
- Make the Thalmor a **credible** social threat:
  - place scene aspects like **“Diplomatic Immunity”**, **“Eyes Everywhere”**, **“Smiling Knives”**
  - weaponize compels: reputations, loyalties, racial prejudice, fear of Dominion retaliation

## Branches & Outcomes
- **Stormcloak Victory:** Ulfric must choose pride vs. pragmatism. A temporary alliance is possible—but
  compel it often.
- **Imperial Victory:** Elisif/Tullius must admit the Empire’s compromises with the Dominion. The PCs can
  force transparency.
- **Stalemate/Truce Ending:** makes Act V smoother mechanically (shared resources), but social scenes are
  explosive.

### Act V Success
The Thalmor plan is stopped, key agents exposed or driven out, and Skyrim gains breathing room to heal.
Set a lasting campaign aspect like: **“Skyrim Watches the Dominion”**.

### Act V Partial Success
The plan is *blunted* but not destroyed. The Thalmor retreat and regroup. A future Season is implied.
Set: **“The Dominion Remembers”**.

### Act V Failure
The Thalmor achieve their objective. Skyrim “wins” a civil war but loses the peace. Set:
**“Puppet Strings in the Snow”** and consider a Dragonbreak/Secret Turn to keep play moving without
hard‑stopping the campaign.

## Rewards (Milestone Suggestions)
- **Major Milestone:** new/updated High Concept; one new stunt; clear one lingering consequence
- **Narrative Reward:** official title, land grant, or a faction command (Companions / College / Guild / etc.)
- **Gear Reward:** one *named* item as an Extra (not necessarily supernatural), plus an ally resource
