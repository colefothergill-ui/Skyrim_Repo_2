# Sanguine — A Night to Remember

## Quest Summary
A blackout comedy spiral that turns into consequences and favors owed.

## Recommended Act
Act I–II

## Key Beats
- Wake up with missing time and new enemies.
- Chase the trail of chaos across holds.
- Realize a Prince engineered the “party.”
- Accept the staff… and the reputation.

## Choice Points
- Own the chaos vs clean it up.
- Apologize and repair harm vs double down.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Sanguine Rose:** Once per session, summon a temporary ally (a “helpful” dremora) as a Create Advantage at +2. GM compels “unreliable help.”

## Champion Mechanic

**Life of the Party (Sanguine’s Favorite)**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Sanguine** up when indulgence creates fallout. Fill = scandal; drunk brawls; social chaos follows.
