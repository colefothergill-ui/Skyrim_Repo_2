# Clavicus Vile — A Daedra’s Best Friend

## Quest Summary
A wish‑granting Prince with legal‑ese energy, a talking dog, and a bargain designed to go sideways.

## Recommended Act
Act I–II

## Key Beats
- Meet Barbas; follow the trail to Vile’s shrine.
- Retrieve the item Vile demands (or negotiate).
- Choose the fate of Barbas (and the bargain’s outcome).

## Choice Points
- Keep the dog alive vs take the weapon and sever the bond.
- Make a clean deal vs try to out‑lawyer a Daedra.

## Artifact (Extra)
**Masque of Clavicus Vile / Rueful Axe:** Pick one. Masque: +2 to Rapport/Deceit to negotiate once per scene. Axe: +2 to Fight when you strike a *betrayer*; GM compels the axe toward cruelty.

## Champion Mechanic
If the PC embraces the Prince’s path, add an aspect:
**Contract‑Signed in Blood**

## Daedric Influence
Tick **Vile** up when the PC bargains for advantage at a cost. Fill = offers appear everywhere; allies doubt the PC’s motives.

## GM Compels (Use Often)
- “Everything’s a Deal”
- “Fine Print”
- “Barbas Remembers”
