# Side Plot C — Allegiances in War (Faction Questlines)

These faction arcs run **in parallel** to the Civil War Acts. They’re designed to:
- give the PC(s) long‑term identity anchors (Aspects + Stunts/Extras),
- provide meaningful *non‑war* stakes,
- and let faction outcomes **bend** Act II–IV battle conditions.

## How to Use
- Pick **0–2** faction arcs as “primary” for a given PC, and treat the rest as optional cameos.
- Each faction file provides:
  - a questline overview,
  - key beats,
  - clocks,
  - rewards (stunts/extras),
  - and where it plugs into Acts I–V.

## Alignment Notes (Soft, Not Hard Locks)
Use these as narrative logic checks, not prison bars:
- **Companions:** any alignment
- **College:** any alignment (politics hate mages either way)
- **Thieves Guild:** Imperial/neutral tends to fit best
- **Dark Brotherhood:** Stormcloak/anti‑Imperial tends to fit best
- **Forsworn:** complicated—often anti‑both, but workable with the right PC
- **Thalmor:** “play with fire” arc—recommended only for campaigns leaning into espionage

## Faction Clocks (Recommended)
Track progress with 6‑segment clocks:
- companions_harbinger
- college_eye_of_magnus
- thieves_guild_restoration
- dark_brotherhood_emperor_plot
- forsworn_rebellion
- thalmor_shadow_war

(These should be present in `clocks/skyrim_clocks.json` after applying this update.)
