# Thalmor — Shadow War

## Fantasy Pitch
The “enemy” isn’t one battle. It’s paperwork, blackmail, disappearances, and smiling cruelty.

## Recommended Act
Threads begin in **Act II**, intensify in **Act III–IV**, and culminate in **Act V**.

## Core Beats
1. **Soft Power:** Thalmor “advisors” appear; political pressure increases
2. **Disappearances:** civilians, priests, and dissidents vanish
3. **False Flags:** violence staged to inflame war hatred
4. **The Dossier:** hard proof of orchestration (this is Act V fuel)
5. **Exposure / Retaliation:** the Dominion strikes back or retreats to regroup

## Clocks
- **thalmor_shadow_war (6):** ticks whenever the PCs ignore Dominion activity.
- Optional: **fear_of_the_dominion (4):** fills = public compliance and cowardice.

## War Integration
- A filled Thalmor clock makes Act IV harder: more elite agents, worse battlefield “accidents.”
- A broken Thalmor network can unlock a truce scene: “we settle this later—first we survive.”

## Rewards
### Dominion Dossier (Extra)
If the PCs secure proof, they can invoke it once per session to:
- force a concession in a political/social scene, or
- create advantage **“The Truth is Public”** with one free invoke.

## GM Compels
- “Diplomatic Immunity”
- “They Know Your Name”
- “Racism as a Weapon”
