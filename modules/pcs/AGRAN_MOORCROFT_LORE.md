## Backstory (summary)
Born late Second Era as Lord Peryn Ashhart of Daggerfall, battlemage prodigy with a gift for Alteration and a soldier’s discipline. Rose to Commander in the Legion during Septim consolidation campaigns. Abducted and turned by a Cyrodilic vampyr cabal (“The Order”) via betrayal by an Imperial mage he courted—intended as a proxy to influence the new empire. His “undying” legend spread. Nearly destroyed by a famed vampire hunter, escaped with help from the same Imperial woman. Fled to Skyrim, reinvented himself as Agran Moorcroft, and became a long-lived fixture of the College of Winterhold—changing names over generations, a one-man bloodline, seeking redemption through teaching and service.
